# 👋 Hey there, I'm Yuri Ranjit

🎯 **Quality Assurance Specialist | Project Manager | Detail-Oriented Troubleshooter**

I live at the crossroads of *precision testing*, *creative problem-solving*, and *no-BS project execution*. My daily grind revolves around uncovering bugs that hide in plain sight, improving app reliability, and managing cross-functional teams like a tactician playing 4D chess.

## 🛠️ What I Do Best

- **QA & Testing:**  
  I specialize in poking holes in your “it works on my machine” assumptions. From exploratory testing to regression, I find the edge cases and break things *so users don’t have to*.
  
- **Bug Reports that Slap:**  
  I write clear, concise, and reproducible reports that don’t make devs want to throw their monitors.

- **Project Management:**  
  I manage multiple client projects across design, development, AI, and marketing. Think of me as the glue that keeps the chaos organized.

- **Process Optimization:**  
  I’m constantly questioning: *"Can this be leaner, smarter, faster?"* Spoiler: It usually can.

## 🚀 Key Projects

- **KUKU (TikTok-style app):**  
  Oversaw QA and server tracking for a dynamic content-sharing platform. Coordinated between devs, WordPress, and hosting teams to keep things smooth.

- **Ruby Homes:**  
  Led digital transformation, covering website dev, SMM, design, and server management. Tracked invoices like a hawk.

- **4A Consultation:**  
  Managed a hybrid stack of services—AI, video editing, portals, and web design—while keeping creative and tech teams aligned.

- **RFM | Innovative Associates | Wave Institute:**  
  Consistent delivery of web, app, and design solutions while managing recurring support, branding, and Meta ads.

## 🧠 How I Think

- **Analytical AF:**  
  I don’t just spot bugs—I think in patterns, edge cases, and risk profiles.

- **Skeptically Curious:**  
  Every spec hides unspoken assumptions. I ask the uncomfortable "what if" questions.

- **Encouraging but Real:**  
  I give feedback with humor and honesty. Sugarcoating is for candy, not QA.

## 💬 Favorite Sayings

> “If it hasn’t been tested, it doesn’t work.”

## 🎓 Always Leveling Up

📚 Currently working on hitting Band 8–9 in IELTS writing. Because communication is half the battle.
