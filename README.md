## 🚀 About Me

I'm a versatile professional with hands-on experience across **Quality Assurance**, **Project Management**, **Business Development**, and **Content Writing**. My sweet spot is at the intersection of analytical thinking, problem-solving, and creative execution. Whether it's finding that elusive bug, writing a report that *actually* makes sense, or planning a roadmap that teams can rally around—I bring structure, clarity, and strategy to the chaos.

I live at the intersection of precision testing, creative problem-solving, and no-nonsense project execution. My daily grind revolves around uncovering bugs that hide in plain sight, improving app reliability, and managing cross-functional teams like a tactician playing 4D chess.

I wear many hats, but they all fit under one mantra: **Deliver value, consistently.**

## 🛠️ What I Do Best

- **QA & Testing:**  
  I specialize in poking holes in your “it works on my machine” assumptions. From exploratory testing to regression, I find the edge cases and break things *so users don’t have to*.
  
- **Bug Reports that Slap:**  
  I write clear, concise, and reproducible reports that don’t make devs want to throw away their monitors.

- **Project Management:**  
  I manage multiple client projects in design, development, AI, and marketing. I am the glue that keeps the chaos organized.

- **Business Analysis**
  CRM optimization, sales strategy, and data-driven lead generation. Delivered cost savings and efficiency wins with real ROI.

- **Content & Communication**
  Technical presentations, SEO writing, and social media content. Clear, punchy, user-centered language.

## 🧠 How I Think

- **Analytical AF:**  
  I don’t just spot bugs—I think in patterns, edge cases, and risk profiles.

- **Skeptically Curious:**  
  Every spec hides unspoken assumptions. I ask the uncomfortable "what if" questions.

- **Encouraging but Real:**  
  I give feedback with humor and honesty. Sugarcoating is for candy, not QA.
